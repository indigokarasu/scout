# CHANGELOG

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-08

### Multi-Platform Compatibility Migration

- Adopted agentskills.io open standard for skill packaging
- Replaced skill.json with YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md

- Added metadata.hermes and metadata.openclaw extension points
- Compatible with both OpenClaw and Hermes Agent


## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-02

## 2.5.0 — 2026-03-30

### Added
- `references/plans/contact-enrichment.plan.md` — bundled workflow plan: Weave lookup → Scout research → Weave social graph update
