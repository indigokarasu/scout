    is noise when comparing two spelled-out names. Callers that compare a contact

    family-name agreement. Whoever opts in must also require the family name to be
    among the shared tokens, or "<Given> A. <Family1>" and "<Given> A. <Family2>"
    share two tokens while naming different people.
