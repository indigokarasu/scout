"""Scout person-research entrypoint (Tier 1 person OSINT).

The runnable implementation of the `scout.research.start` step described in
references/plans/contact-enrichment.plan.md. Given a name and whatever context
the address book already holds (email, org, occupation, city, and any profile
URLs the user hand-entered), it:

  1. USES known profile URLs as context. A URL already on the contact record
     is something the user typed, so it is recorded with provenance
     'contact_record', GitHub URLs are expanded via the structured users API,
     personal sites are cheaply title-fetched, and LinkedIn is recorded WITHOUT
     scraping (auth-walled). It does NOT by itself resolve identity — see (5).
     Getting that URL into weave is google_sync.py's job (it imports Google
     Contacts urls directly at 0.95); scout does not need to launder it
     through a corroboration gate it cannot honestly pass.
  2. Derives distinctive handle candidates from (a) explicit handles, (b) the
     slug of any known profile URL (linkedin.com/in/rheaott -> 'rheaott'),
     (c) the email local-part, and (d) name combinations — (d) only when the
     email handle is generic or absent.
  3. Runs Maigret (username -> 3000+ sites, with profile metadata) and Holehe
     (email -> which sites the address is registered on) from the isolated
     OSINT venv. Holehe needs only the email and runs even when no handle
     candidate survives.
  4. Enriches GitHub hits via the structured users API.
  5. CORROBORATES identity across sources: a profile only counts if its
     reported full name agrees with the contact's name (scout's normalizer).
     This is the discriminator that accepts 'wrenkeeley' -> Wren Keeley and
     rejects a common handle like 'geekgirl' whose profiles name other people.
     Seeding a handle from a known URL does NOT weaken this gate — a maigret
     hit on a URL-derived handle still has to pass the name test.

     Corroboration requires an INDEPENDENT anchor, and two cases are therefore
     explicitly NOT corroboration:
       * a handle MANUFACTURED from the contact's name (name_handle_variants).
         The pivot and the check would be the same signal, so any namesake
         passes trivially. Those hits are returned with circular_anchor=True
         and zero corroboration weight; the raw measurement is kept under
         name_shared_tokens_raw / family_present_raw.
       * a hand-entered URL on its own. It is an assertion about which account
         belongs to the contact, not verification of what some third-party
         profile says. Alone it yields identity 'low' (below the write gate);
         combined with one name-corroborated site it yields 'high'.
     A curated URL whose FETCHED name names someone else is marked
     name_conflict and is excluded from anchors and enrichment entirely.
  6. FALLS BACK to a capped SearXNG name+org / name+occupation search when the
     handle pivot corroborates nothing. A candidate that is never opened cannot
     corroborate anything, so raw snippets are returned as UNVERIFIED CANDIDATES
     and neither raise the identity level nor produce enrichment. A candidate
     whose page IS fetched and whose text names the contact — given and family
     name adjacent, not merely both present somewhere on the page — meets the
     same corroboration standard as any other profile and does count. Those
     pages appear in identity.corroborating_sites.
  7. Probes the sources that reach a contact with NO handle and NO profile
     anywhere — the population this pipeline fails on. Each is fail-soft and
     each produces CANDIDATES that face the same name gate as everything else:
       * WHOIS/RDAP on a VANITY domain (one the contact owns, which is exactly
         where employer_from_email returns ""). Most registrations are
         privacy-proxied, and a proxied record is discarded whole rather than
         reported: the phone and city in it are the registrar's, and writing
         them would put a wrong number and a wrong city on every contact whose
         registrar happens to be the same. A record only becomes an anchor when
         the registrant NAME passes _name_confirms, and only then are its second
         email address and phone number reported at all.
       * The WAYBACK MACHINE, when a personal domain no longer resolves. The
         archived page still names them, which is what corroboration needs; a
         dead domain is never published as a live website.
       * EMAIL PERMUTATION at an employer domain (first.last@, flast@,
         firstl@, first@, f.last@), tested for existence with holehe. Corporate
         domains only. holehe proves a mailbox exists, never whose it is, so
         these never raise the identity level and never source a field.
       * PHONE INTELLIGENCE from libphonenumber: region, carrier, line type and
         timezone. Numbers are portable, so the region corroborates a city
         already on file and never establishes one.
  8. Reaches the contacts holding an EMPLOYER NAME and nothing else — no
     address, no profile URL — which is most of the population this pipeline
     fails on. The employer name is resolved to a company DOMAIN (a colleague's
     observed address, a search hit named after the company, or the obvious
     guess — always fetched and required to name the company, because a wrong
     domain is consumed by everything below it). That domain then unlocks the
     employer's own team/about page, a site: filter on the employer, and the
     address permutation that previously could only run for contacts who
     already had a corporate address. A GitHub account that passed the identity
     gate also yields the address its commits are authored from.
  9. Emits scout Findings (finding_id / claim / confidence / source_refs) plus
     structured enrichment fields, each with provenance.

Enrichment fields are drawn ONLY from structured sources (GitHub API company /
location, profile blog_url, pronouns parsed from bios, hand-entered URLs).
Free-text bios and search snippets are surfaced as evidence with quotes —
never regex-scraped into employer fields (that was the old failure mode).
Confidence gates whether the caller writes.

Website selection is ranked, not first-wins: personal domain > github blog >
professional profile (LinkedIn/Crunchbase) > portfolio (Behance/Dribbble/
Medium) > consumer social (Snapchat/TikTok/Duolingo/Chess) last.

Stdlib + subprocess only. Network egress happens inside maigret/holehe, the
GitHub API call, the optional page-title fetch, and the local SearXNG query.

# passed the identity gate, and a contact with no email has no email-derived
# handle, so the only handles available are manufactured from their name — which
# the gate correctly refuses as circular. The account was unreachable precisely
# for the population the technique was built for.
#
# GitHub's user search closes that loop with an INDEPENDENT signal. It matches
# on the profile's own `name` field, which the account owner typed, not on a
# handle we derived from the contact. A hit is then confirmed against two things
# the contact record already asserts — their name AND (employer or city) — so a
# namesake with a different company or city is refused rather than harvested.
